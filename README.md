# counsel-mairix - fast, real-time email searching in the minibuffer
[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~ane/counsel-mairix.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~ane/counsel-mairix?)

counsel-mairix is an [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) interface for rapidly going through [Mairix](https://github.com/vandry/mairix) search
results.  Mairix is a very fast mail searching program.  Combining it with an
ivy completion interface, you can search your emails interactively in the
minibuffer, results update as you type. Additionally, if you're looking at an
email, you can quickly insert search terms based on the email.

By default, Mairix works by saving the search results into a separate
file, like a unix [Mbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) file, and then you point your email program to that file
to display the result. This can be quite inconvenient, since you have to reopen
the search mailbox every time your search query changes. Using Ivy, we can now
interactively refine our search and view the results in real time.

Currently this is very much a **work in progress**. counsel-mairix depends on the
[Emacs Interface for Mairix](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/mairix-el/index.html) which is bundled with Emacs. It should work out of
the box by invoking <kbd>M-x counsel-mairix</kbd> if you have configured it properly (see
[Installation](#installation) below).

**Patches are welcome!** Please note that this package is intended to be a part
of GNU ELPA, thus for patches over >15 lines your FSF paperwork ought to be in
order. Please mail patches to my [public inbox](https://lists.sr.ht/~ane/public-inbox) at [~ane/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht](mailto:~ane/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht).

## Demonstration

*Mairix running on (mostly) the [September 2020 archive of emacs-devel@gnu.org in Mbox format](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/mbox/emacs-devel/2020-09)*.

## Installation

A prerequisite on the system is obviously that Mairix is installed and
configured properly. See [(mairix-el) Configuring mairix](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/mairix-el/Configuring-mairix.html). 
 
Since this is still alpha quality software, it is not available in any package
repository. Thus clone it somewhere in your system and add it to your load path:

``` emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-this-repo>")
```

You can do this using [use-package](http://github.com/jwiegley/use-package):

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package counsel-mairix
  :load-path <path>)
```

If you have the [Emacs Interface for Mairix](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/mairix-el/index.html) configured properly then this should
work without any additional configuration. Otherwise, you need to configure it.
For example, if you use Mairix with Mbox format results, configure it like this:

 ``` emacs-lisp
(setq mairix-file-path "~/mail")        ;; The folder where the search file is stored
(setq mairix-search-file "search.mbox") ;; Name of the search file itself
```

## Functionality

The table below lists a summary of the functions in counsel-mairix.  Please
refer to their documentation in Emacs for more information.

| Function                       | Description                                                     |
|:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `counsel-mairix`               | Run mairix queries interactively                                |
| `counsel-mairix-save-search`   | Save your searches from your previous `counsel-mairix` searches |
| `counsel-mairix-search-from`   | Start a `counsel-mairix` search using the `From:` header        |
| `counsel-mairix-search-thread` | Start a `counsel-mairix` search using the `Message-Id:` header  |

## Keybindings in the Ivy search

### General keybindings

| Binding              | Description                |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------|
| <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd>   | Toggle threading           |
| <kbd>C-c C-s i</kbd> | Insert saved mairix search |
| <kbd>C-c C-s s</kbd> | Save current search        |

### Bindings when viewing an email

If you're viewing an email in one of the major modes Mairix supports, you can
hit these bindings to add them to your search string:

| Binding              | Description                               |
|:---------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>C-c C-f f</kbd> | Yank the `From` value as in your search   |
| <kbd>C-c C-f s</kbd> | Yank the `Subject` value into your search |
| <kbd>C-c C-f t</kbd> | Yank the `To` value into your search      |
| <kbd>C-c C-f i</kbd> | Yank the `Message-Id` into your search    |

Remember that the default binding <kbd>M-j</kbd> (`ivy-yank-word`) to yank
things your cursor is on to insert it into the minibuffer.

With a negative prefix argument (<kbd>M--</kbd> or <kbd>C-u -</kbd>), insert a
*negated* search of the form `f:~foo@bar.com` which would search messages
**not** matching that address. This also applies for avy searches below.

#### [avy](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) bindings

If avy is installed, the following avy search refinements are available.

| Binding              | Description                                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>C-c C-a t</kbd> | Avy pick one `To` address and insert it into the search       |
| <kbd>C-c C-a c</kbd> | Avy pick one `CC` address and insert it into the search       |
| <kbd>C-c C-a s</kbd> | Avy pick one word from `Subject` and insert into the search   |
| <kbd>C-c C-a b</kbd> | Avy pick one word from the body and insert into the search    |
| <kbd>C-c C-a a</kbd> | Avy pick any word from the message and insert into the search |

With the prefix argument, it will insert the respective mairix search pattern
(`f:` for `From`) before the picked item. If the pattern is already inserted,
the pattern is refined, i.e. if the search string is `t:foo@bar.com`, picking a
new address `xyz@zy.com` will turn it into `t:foo@bar.com,xyz@zy.com`, unless
the prefix argument is given, in which case a new pattern is inserted, turning
it into `t:foo@bar.com t:xyz@zy.com`. This does not apply for yanking anything.

![avy demo](./demo2.gif)

Here, I'm interested in emacs-devel discussions about key bindings, so I start
by creating a subject search term using `s:`. I yank the words `key` and
`bindings` using avy, note that the second yank inserts a comma to create a
search of the form `s:key,binding` which matches when both `key` and `bindings`
are mentioned. Then I'm also interested in what Stefan Monnier and Eli Zaretskii
have to say about it, so I insert `f:` and yank one of the `Cc` targets using
`C-a C-c c` and then add an OR search using `/` and then insert the `To` target
using `C-c C-f t`. Finally, I'm just interested in what Stefan and Eli have to
say about it, so I toggle threads OFF using `C-c C-t`.

## Customization

counsel-mairix defines the following customization variables:

### Custom variable: `counsel-mairix-mail-frontend`

Override the mail program used to create the Ivy search buffer. 

This setting can override which mail program you are normally using for Mairix
searches defined in [`mairix-mail-program`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/mairix-el/Extending.html). This can be useful if you want
traditional Mairix searches to use some mail program (e.g. Gnus) but prefer
another program to display the Ivy buffer.

It defaults to the value of `mairix-mail-program`.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq counsel-mairix-mail-frontend 'rmail)
```

This would force counsel-mairix to use Rmail for displaying the search buffer.

### Custom variable: `counsel-mairix-include-threads`

Whether to prompt for including threads in the Mairix search. Mairix.el defaults
to querying every time, but I found this behaviour annoying.

Set it to

  * `'prompt` to ask every time (the default)
  * `t` to always include threads
  * `nil` to never include threads.

## TODO stuff (if you feel like contributing)

**Gnus** and **VM** aren't supported as display frontends.

These could go into the ticket tracker.
